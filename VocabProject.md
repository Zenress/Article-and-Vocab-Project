### Offline Holdout set

An Offline Holdout set is a dataset that was set aside locally/temporarily during runtime. This helps with testing the performance of a Machine learning model because the model wonâ€™t know about the data so you can test how well it does on unknown data

### Machine Learning Pipeline

A Machine Learning pipeline is the definition of the entire process from getting the dataset to training a model and then delivering it. Of course, there are exceptions to this e.g., when you have to large an amount of data so the data preparation could be handled separately

### Machine Learning Model

A Machine Learning Model is a file that through training with an algorithm, can recognize certain types of patterns and predict the result of something using these patterns. The specific patterns and what it can predict depends on what algorithm you use.

### DecisionTreeClassifier

Is an algorithm that functions by making a yes/no (e.g., bigger than/less than) condition that continually split the dataset until it finds a sequence of nodes that points to a class in your dataset. It repeats the process until conditions that point to your classes are done

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is the practice of continuously merging different branches of a source control platform to ensure that the version people are working on are also up to date to eachothers changes. This helps a lot with making sure you don't get huge amounts of merging conflicts when merging big projects.

### MLFlow Expirement

An experiment is a way to organize different trials and or mlruns. It allows you to categorize runs and their statistics/metrics and artifacts under one category. It allows you to have different testing and production experiments, so you can have them seperated.

### Linear Regression

Is a method to predict using a lot of datapoints to form a prediction line.
