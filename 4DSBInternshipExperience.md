# DSB Internship Experience

This article is about my personal experience as an intern in DSB over the past 8 Months.

Mentor: Michele Stawowy

Intern: Me

Internship duration: 8 Months.

Internship purpose: To let me gain work experience, learn and be able to contribute to a team on a level that would satisfy what a Junior Machine Learning Engineer does.

Internship goal: Getting hired and continueing my work.

## How it started

The internship came about in a little bit of an unusual way.
It all started with me looking for places to learn about Machine Learning and AI, every place responded back either with a roundabout way to say no, or didn't answer at all.

This caused me to look again and i saw the opportunity for DSB's graduate program, i thought to myself.

> Hey, what if i try to get in but make my internship look better than the graduate, essentially making it a better deal for DSB

I achieved this by basically giving DSB the opportunity to teach someone exactly the way they would need someone to work within the team.

Was this a tiny bit arrogant maybe? *Yes*, but i took a chance and I can't believe how well it payed off.
Truly a stroke of luck that I feel great amount of gratitude towards

## The good and bad

### The Good

There was a lot of good things about my internship, one of the bigger things was that i had the opportunity to get real work experience, something i myself was lacking. 
Along with work experience came a lot of opportunity to learn and ask questions that are hard to answer without googling for a while.
Along with the fact that i was lucky to be put on a really good team with great people.

### The Bad

Ironically, this section is gonna be a lot more empty than the wording makes it seem.

The only really bad thing i can come up with is the bureaucracy.
Things like: having to follow the procedures for everything, from getting data to applying for vacation.
This can seem tedious at times, but in the end it's for your own good since you will have evidence somewhere of the interaction instead of verbal agreements only

## The journey

The journey in DSB has felt both short and at times long. There were a good amount of ups and downs, but i am coming away from this internship with newfound knowledge, experience and gratitude towards the patience of the people in my team. Wanting to teach me even when i was clueless or at times plain wrong was a great experience.

### The beginning

In the beginning of the internship i was really nervous, as you normally would be.
Since i knew nobody there and even if i'm decent at directions i felt like i could get lost in the workplace at anytime.

But slowly and surely i got more familiar with the surroundings and in general i felt i could begin learning more about my coworkers and focus more on learning what was needed to contribute to the team.

It started out small with trying to make a Machine Learning pipeline from scratch without any help, to see how far i would get and so my mentor could feel out my skill level.
After that i began learning how to use Github pull requests and i slowly began evolving my pipeline with each subsequent pull request.

From a python script with barely and coding standards and best practices upheld to a document that upholds all the coding standards most commonly used as well as the best practices.
From documentation, pythonic functions to seperation of concerns and so on.

In the end i have ended up with an MLFlow pipeline that uses sklearn's decisiontree classifier to classify different types of Irises.
In contrast, i started out during the same classification using Tensorflow and Keras neural networks.

### The middle and the splitting paths

When i reached the middle of the internship a lot of things had changed.
I was slowly beginning to deliver value to the team.

Which meant that i would be focusing more on working on tasks along with the team, instead of doing my own thing. Thereby splitting myself from what you would consider normal internship work.

This turned out to be incredibly valuable for me, and i got a really good feel for how to work well inside of a team. 
A lot of my social skills got better as well as i could begin to get a better fell of how to interact with people you don't know that much about on a proffessional level.

### Towards the end

Now that I've slowly reached the end of my internship along with this article. 
I would like to add some closing words about how i felt about the internship as a whole.

This internship is one of the best opportunities i have gotten in my life and i really cherish the time working in DSB as an intern, irrgardless of what ends up happening with my future in the end.

I will continue to strive towards bettering myself as an ML Engineer and regardless if that's within DSB or not, i will still remember all I've learned during this time. 
I will not let my standards slack and keep up a good work ethic.
