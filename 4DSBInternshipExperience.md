# DSB Internship Experience

This article is about my personal experience as an intern in DSB over the past 6 months

Mentor: Michele Stawowy

Intern: Me

Internship duration: 7-8 Months (At time of writing 7 months.)

Internship purpose: To let me gain work experience, learn and be able to contribute to a team on a level that would satisfy what a Junior Machine Learning Engineer does.

## The good and bad

### The Good

There was a lot of good things about my internship, one of the bigger things was that i had the opportunity to get real work experience, something i myself was lacking. 
Along with work experience came a lot of opportunity to learn and ask questions that are hard to answer without googling for a while.
Along with the fact that i was lucky to be put on a really good team with great people.

### The Bad

Ironically, this section is gonna be a lot more empty than the wording makes it seem.

The only really bad thing i can come up with is the bureaucracy.
Things like: having to follow the procedures for everything, from getting data to applying for vacation.
This can seem tedious at times, but in the end it's for your own good since you will have evidence somewhere of the interaction instead of verbal agreements only
## The journey

### The beginning

In the beginning of the internship i was really nervous, as you normally would be. 
Since i knew nobody there and even if i'm decent at directions i felt like i could get lost in the workplace at anytime.

But slowly and surely i got more familiar with the surroundings and in general i felt i could begin learning more about my coworkers and focus more on learning what was needed to contribute to the team.

It started out small with trying to make a Machine Learning pipeline from scratch without any help, to see how far i would get and so my mentor could feel out my skill level. 
After that i began learning how to use Github pull requests and i slowly began evolving my pipeline with each subsequent pull request.

From a python script with barely and coding standards and best practices upheld to a document that upholds al the coding standards most commonly used as well as the best practices. From documentation, pythonic functions to seperation of concerns and so on.

In the end i have ended up with an MLFlow pipeline that uses sklearn's decisiontree classifier to classify different types of Irises. 
In contrast, i started out during the same classification using Tensorflow and Keras neural networks.
